    <h2>Hello 2022!</h2>
    <p class="lead">Happy New Year 2022: As the world bids goodbye to a year to welcome another, people get together with their friends and families on New Year's Eve to celebrate the joyous occasion with gifts, lavish feasts, parties and more. New Year is celebrated around the globe with much enthusiasm, mainly because it is the beginning of a new year. It symbolises happy beginnings, renewed energy and hope for a better year. The past two years (2020 and 2021) have been challenging because of the Covid-19. Therefore, the hope for 2022 to be a great year is very much on everyone's mind.</p>
